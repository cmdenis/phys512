## Question 1

We first look at the electric field of a uniformily charged ring. We kow that, along the central axis of this ring, we have the field

$$E_c = \frac{Q z}{4\pi \epsilon_0(z^2 + R^2)^{3/2}} $$

(found on [Hyperphysics](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/electric/elelin.html)).

We can plot this function:
