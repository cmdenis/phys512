# Final Project

By Christian Denis for PHYS-512

## Part 1

Here we use an $n$-body simulation to show the behavior of a single particle. This is more of a test than anything.

## Part 2

Here we use the same $n$-body simulation to show two particles orbiting each other. This result is more interesting than the previous one, but is also sort of a test to make sure our simulation doesn't present any problems. The following GIF shows the simulation:

We see that the two particles are indeed in orbit. One somewhat undesirable feature of the simulation is the fast that the particles keep drifting. I think this might be caused by two things. First, because of the periodic boundary conditions
