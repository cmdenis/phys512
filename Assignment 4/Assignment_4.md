## Question 1

### Part a)

### Part b)

### Part c)

Our answers in **c** are not statistically significantly different from the answers in **a**. They all fall well within the error margin found in **a**.

### Part d)

### Part e)

If we look at the residuals for the data and the beat fit, we clearly see some structure in there.

The first noticeable thing is that there are some "saw-tooth" in the data. At first I thought that this was coming from taking the derivative rather crudely but the fitting function is too smooth for these artifacts to occur. Hence I suppose that it must be coming from the data.

### Part f)

### Part g)
